This is an exploratory project I created back in 2006 during my recruitment into AppAssure Software.  The purpose of this project is to explore
the performance characteristics of various asynchronous I/O techniques under Windows, so as to establish a theoretical upper bound on bulk
data transfer performance between two Windows hosts over a GigE LAN.
